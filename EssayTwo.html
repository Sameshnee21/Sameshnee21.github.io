      <h1>Essay Two: Mitigating the Risk of Extinction From AI.</h1>

      <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        When a person gains access into a system, they initially engage the
        controls within that system. This experience is defined as the user
        interface or (UI). The user interface (UI), “is an interface design for
        machines and software, such as computers, mobile phones, and other
        electronic devices” (Nurpalah et al., 2021). Functionally, the user
        interface provides a link or communication on the main operating system
        to ensure that the user can fully experience the full scope of the
        system being accessed (Nurpalah et al., 2021). In contrast, user
        experience or (UX), “is about how a person feels” when that engagement
        between themselves and the system is realized (Nurpalah et al., 2021).
        Nurpalah et al (2021), affirms that a system “can be a website,
        software, or other computer application and program” within the
        prevailing age where human and machine engagements are a common
        narrative. UI and UX, is therefore a manifestation of the system or
        platform, that is designed to appeal to the user and draw their
        attention to the contents of that system. The interaction with users is
        not a condition of all systems. For example, ubiquitous systems exist
        where technology facilitates certain activities to be accomplished
        without the specific interaction between the system and the user
        (Resnick, 2013). Ubiquitous technology provides new challenges for
        functional design since user experience is limited or absent. These
        systems therefore have a specific design and incorporates limited
        interaction between the user and the system as part of its design
        (Resnick, 2013). In the modern era however, increasing technology,
        induce users to seek more interaction. According to Ballatore et al.,
        (2017), “our spatial interactions and experiences with the world are
        increasingly digital”. If we look at the World Wide Web for example,
        user interaction is reaching 3.5 billion people who have the capacity
        irrespective of location to access and contribute to creating knowledge
        (Bloom, 2004).
      </p>

      <h2>INTERACTION STRUCTURED BY UI AND UX</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        A well-constructed user interface is central to a valuable user
        experience. If the user interface is difficult to use, chances are that
        the user will lose interest in the product or service being sold or
        alternatively contribute to increased maintenance costs (The Basic
        Principles of User Interface Design, n.d.). According to the ISO 9241
        report, 3 usability is defined as: “the extent to which a product can be
        used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness,
        efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use” (Alomari et
        al., 2020). The augmentation of the digital world through technology
        means an expansion of the user experience. Digitization and content
        creation does not only replicate the world in another form but also
        recreates it (Alomari et al., 2020). If we look at search engines for
        example, Ballatore et al., (2017) claims that they have formed a
        knowledge architecture with a specific set of principles, lucidities and
        preferences. UX is a result of a “user’s internal state, characteristics
        of the designed system and the context within which the interaction
        occurs” (Hassenzahl & Tractinsky, 2006). The culmination of this, opens
        a number of creative and innovative prospects especially for user
        experience(Hassenzahl & Tractinsky, 2006). This however does not exist
        in isolation as any user experience emanates from interaction(Cybulski &
        Horbinski, 2020). According to Cybulski & Horbinski, (2020), user
        interface are the mechanisms that make communication possible. With the
        level and complexity of interaction ethical considerations become more
        prominent. According to Gray & Chivukula, (2019), there has not been
        enough research that outlines the ethical parameters within which
        designers are comfortable.
      </p>

      <h2>ETHICS OF INTERACTION</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Over the years, there has been keen interest on ethics and its impact on
        design and technology (Findeli, 2001; Gray & Chivukula, 2019). A
        research project “Prometheus Enlightened” conducted on design ethics and
        the responsibilities of the designer during 1989 -1992 concluded the
        following i.e., the definition of professional responsibility requires
        clarity on the aim of design, importance should be given to development
        of “design education” and lastly designers should be accountable for
        their work. With the evolution of design from the Bauhaus line, the
        design landscape has changed to accommodate the effects of
        environmental, social and cultural issues to formulate a more balanced
        perspective. The design and development of art may no longer be seen as
        a normal course of events without considering ethics as the framework
        since designers are involved in the act of recreating their version of
        the biosphere (Findeli, 2001). 4 Increasing technological advancements
        and digitization means that designers play a significant role in all
        aspects of everyday life. With the explosion of the World wide Web and
        information sourcing to understand the population better, digital
        discrimination is evident from the huge disparities that exist from a
        social, economic and cultural perspective. The digital divide widens
        further when we view participation, access to technology between
        developed countries and developing countries. Digital disparities such
        as those linked to skills, access and ability affect a significant
        section of the world. Further augmentation of the internet in everyday
        life allows for these disparities to leach into areas such as race,
        class, gender and other aspects of cultural segmentation (Robinson et
        al., 2015).
      </p>

      <h2>ANALYSIS OF UI AND UX OF THE WEBSITE SOLAR ADVICE</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        The website chosen for analysis is “Solar Advice”. “Solar Advice” is a
        company providing solar solutions to households and corporate
        enterprises (SolarAdvice, 2023). Touted by “MY Broadband” as one of the
        top home solar companies in the country, they provide a range of
        solutions for the massive power outages experienced by the country. In
        general, their website is easy to use and has a range of solutions to
        view. The general design of the website is a 2D layout, however it is
        smooth and transitions into the next page easily through the user
        interface. The user interface tools are clearly marked and positioned at
        the top of the screen so that minimal effort is used in trying to locate
        a particular page. Scrolling through the home page provides a range of
        information and guidelines. The 2D UI layout has two advantages in that
        it is follows a traditional format arrangement as found in web and
        mobile design. The UI components are crafted on traditional usage norms
        with functions available by a quick scan. Although set within a 3D
        space, it brings forth some disadvantages such as it cannot fully
        exploit the 3D space and use technology such as virtual reality. In
        addition, with the 2D layout the “visual impact on the user experience
        is much lower than expected” (Xing et al., n.d.). Websites provide a
        much more interactive experience for accomplishing activities(Aizpurua
        et al., 2016). The accomplishment of a website may not only depend on
        its actual features, but also on how it is experienced by users
        (Hassenzahl, 2009). The user experience provided by the website
        “SolarAdvice” is good since it 5 has a number of features that makes it
        interesting for the user. The range of solutions and the ability to
        tailor each solution to fit the user’s budget also makes it
        advantageous. The website provides a dynamic experience since it is
        easily accessible and useable (Aizpurua et al., 2016). The website is
        also aesthetically pleasing to the eye and users can easily experience
        the seamless transition to the graphical interface. According to
        Lanquetin, (2006), ethical principles such as computer as information
        repository, information ownership, responsibilities, computers as
        thinking machines and communication in networks motivated by Parker et
        al., (1990) and Johnson, (1993) have to be considered. The “SolarAdvice”
        website acts as a repository for personal information when a quotation
        is requested, and payment is done. This information can be stolen as the
        information is stored. The site also does not provide any information
        about the company and its employees; therefore, the ownership of the
        information can be disputed. The website details are not clearly
        expressed, so it is not clearly stated who is responsible for the
        content or the content is stated correctly. In addition, computers “are
        thinking machines”(Lanquetin, 2006), and information can be compromised.
        Finally, communication in networks can be compromised to pose as
        employees and therefore facilitate fraudulent sales.

      <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        In this paper we have described how the “SolarAdvice” website has
      structured UI and UX for improved interaction. Based on the user interface
      provided by the tools on the website, the general construction, usability
      and seamless transition from one page to the next combined with the range
      of information to prospective buyers made the overall user experience a
      pleasant one. Although these aspects contribute to a positive experience
      and has significant chance of increasing sales, ethical considerations of
      the website has to be noted. “SolarAdvice” has to review the aspects that
      may compromise the website such as information security and the threat of
      the system being hacked and strengthen these to ensure an ethical system.
