    <h5 class="sub">My experience starting HTML:</h5>
    <p>
      My experience with HTML has been very exciting as the lecture video is
      informative and well put together for a beginner. Initially, I was nervous
      as last year's coding went south in many ways. I find that HTML is easier
      to understand and highly enjoyable. I look forward to the process of
      building my first website with the knowledge that I have attained thus
      far.

    <h5 class="sub">Reflection of readings:</h5>
    <p>
      In the reading, “Why you should choose HTML5”, I found that the passage
      was well detailed in terms of examples and actual code to refer to. As
      someone new to coding, I understood the text to an extent of the different
      between article and section. Before the reading, I thought that it was
      just coders having fun with non-coders, but now I know that there is a
      clear distinction. article is an independent item that can be used
      constantly. section, on the other hand, is a type of organizing tool used
      to separate paragraphs. As for the “How a screen reader user accesses the
      web” reading, it was an eye opener. Although as designers, user-friendly
      designs are always a priority, it was a “cool idea” that eventually
      vanished due to time constraints and dead ends. Another factor that stood
      out in the reading, is that although the creators had user accessibility
      in mind, it became an inconvenience to the user when they were not able to
      skip certain parts of the website. In order to avoid such episodes in the
      near future, coders should allow the target users to “playtest” the
      prototype before it becomes live to other users.

    <h5 class="sub">Reflection on Internet Histories:</h5>
    <p>
      I find it fascinating how far the internet has come and even more
      intriguing that the initial idea was never lost over the years. The
      timeline put the actual iterations, people involved and everything in
      between in perspective. I wonder what the future holds for those that want
      to take the internet one step further.
