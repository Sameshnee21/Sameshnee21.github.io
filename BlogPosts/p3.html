    <h5 class="sub">My experience with the development of my website:</h5>

    <p>
      Although I am still in my brainstorming phase, I have realized that with
      the knowledge I have attained, I need to conceptualize my idea in a more
      realistic manner. I have been intrigued by bike website layouts (Ducati,
      Honda, Kawasaki and the classic ones such as Harley Davidson and Indian).
      I have gathered that each of them has a “perk” somewhere in their website
      that makes it unique. Indian, for example, has a 3D model of the selected
      bike and shows what the bike would look like with certain add-ons for
      example another exhaust. I would like to achieve a special and unique perk
      for my website that ender users would appreciate. Although my progress has
      been moving slowly, I have more clarity with my end goal.

      Reflection of the reading and lecture and how they tie into UI / UX:
    </h5>
    <p>
      UI and UX tie into each other so that the end user is comfortable while
      using the app or website. The key aspects that I have gathered from the
      reading is that interactivity is the foundation of UI/ UX designs.
      Interactivity is about responsive behavior, does not have complete control
      and is not random. If the user can interact successfully then YAYY but if
      not, then it's back to the drawing board until we get a YAYY WE DID IT!
    </p>

    <h5 class="sub">Perspective of course material:</h5>
    <p>
      From the previous learning material, I learnt that the use of specificity
      helps the user pick out important words, phrases or actions in a website
      without overriding the headings importance. If the same specificity is
      used in the heading and the text, it will clash and become overwhelming
      for the end user. In the second section of the course material, the
      definition of interaction is emphasized as mentioned in the reflection of
      the readings and lectures. One factor that was highlighted by Ted Nelson
      was that the “origins of content” are interconnected and represented in
      hypermedia. This stands out because without the first steps of research,
      would the internet exist? Would the non -trivial action of clicking and
      typing ever replace the traditional action of flipping a page? Would
      journals and academic readings be available at our fingertips? In my
      opinion, traditional actions will always remain special as it activates 4
      senses (touch, hear, see, smell). A non-trivial action could replace the
      sound of pages flipping and the visuals of a book through graphics and
      sound effects, but it would not be authentic. The origins of content have
      a special place and activate many memories long before the internet
      entered the chat. We can appreciate how far we've come however we should
      still value the old. There is still much to learn about interaction from
      older content, such as how did people achieve this when the internet did
      not exist. We can use these pointers to establish better UI/ UX systems
      for users.

      Yes! It is wayyy too easy to get carried away with designing, and it can
      often lead to over-scoping. But that's not a problem! It's just important
      to narrow it down and identify the aspects that you find important for
      inclusion in your personal website. It's good that you are analyzing
      pre-existing websites and identifying features that you like. How are you
      defining and differentiating between "trivial" and "non-trivial" actions
      as a whole? I can see that you are someone who values the "old". Do you
      think there is a way to combine the "old" and "new" to show that
      appreciation? Would you consider/like to implement this into your website
      aesthetic?
