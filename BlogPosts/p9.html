    <h5 class="sub">Development of my website:</h5>
    <p>
      The further development of my website leaves me in a whirlpool of
      emotions. I have found areas in my website that can be improved through
      Javascript but starting it, has been daunting. I feel that I can improve
      the look and feel of my blog, my portfolio section, and the design
      section. The blog design was a rushed process however I would like to edit
      the background so that its easier on the eyes. My portfolio section can be
      more interactive and user friendly with the layout. As for the design
      section, my layout “bugged out” and needs some serious attention. I feel
      that Javascript can assist this process.

    <h5 class="sub">Digital Inequalities and why they matter:</h5>
    <p>
      Digital inequality is an issue that cannot be easily reversed or
      rehabilitated overnight. It is a way of life and has a “distinct presence”
      in our society (Robinson et al: 2015). Digital inequality is when part of
      the population id digitally dependent whilst the other part is digitally
      disadvantaged. Basic use of technology is a must in today’s world and is a
      crucial part of life as the world is going digital whether or not people
      appreciate it.
