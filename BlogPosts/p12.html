    <h5 class="sub">Development of my website (Part Something):</h5>
    <p>
      The development of my website has not moved from the last time we spoke.
      I’ve been going through my lectures once more and refreshing this ‘ole
      noggin. This isn’t where I wanted to be in my progress however, this was a
      necessary step to better understand my website and ways to improve it.

    <h5 class="sub">API's: What is it:</h5>
    <p>
      API’s is a complicated topic as I haven’t recovered from javascript
      (teehee). On a more serious note, API’s stand for Application Programming
      Interface, this means that it allows two applications to “talk” to each
      other. This sounds complicated however, we use API’s on a daily basis
      without realising it. For example, when playing a mobile game and a
      message appears on your device, you can interact with both programmes at
      the same time. The technical challenges I foresee is how to keep the
      audience’s attention while another program runs in the background. I will
      have to design my website in a way that does not lose my user. This will
      be a challenge and will be time consuming since this may take the designer
      back to wireframes and planning.

    <h5 class="sub">Reflection on the reading:</h5>
    <p>
      I was fortunate enough to have a semester course in gender studies a few
      years ago. I feel that a class like that is important for future designers
      and developers as it broadens your perspective and creates a better
      understanding of todays world. This class allowed me to understand the
      LGBTQ community better and the daily struggles they go through. If
      something as current and new as a body scanner cannot cater for people,
      what is happening? Costanza-Chock (2020) highlights the difficulties faced
      as a person part of the LGBTQ community. As a result of this technological
      discrimination, people don’t feel safe. The main question posed in the
      reading is “how can designers help?”. This is a challenge that forces
      designers to be more knowledgeable and aware of such situations. For an
      issue like this to be addressed, designers must ensure and constantly
      better the “digital justice principles” (Costanza-Chock: 2020) so that it
      is engraved in societies mind.
