    <h5 class="sub">Development of my website:</h5>
    <p>
      After this week's lectures and readings, I need to update the purpose of
      my website to suit the user. My initial design was based on design styles
      that I appreciated. My design was going to include pixel designed chickens
      (because they are so cute) as icons however I now realise that it will go
      against the 14 basic principles of UI design. I need to know what my user
      wants from the website and how to make their lives easier when they
      interact with the system.

      How do wireframes hold up against readings and what iterations are needed:
    </h5>

    <p>
      My wireframe do hold up in certain aspects against the readings such as
      having clear steps to each page, visual hierarchy and the simplicity of
      the design. I do have a few iterations as mentioned above. The readings
      has helped in assisting my design to make it more user friendly.
    </p>

    <h5 class="sub">How does the UI relate to interactivity:</h5>

    <p>
      UI relates to interactivity as they both need each other to function. The
      user needs to interact with the system in order to get feedback.
      Interactivity is based on responsive design, it is controlled by the user
      within the system. UI is based on the visual aspect of the system, if the
      design doesn't visually strike the user then the interactivity of the
      system won't be successful.
    </p>

    <h5 class="sub">Reflection on the readings:</h5>
    <p>
      In Gibson's reading, he references Stelarc who believes that human and
      machine interaction will eventually become a key aspect in our lives. It
      is a frightening reality however technology is slowly taking over certain
      jobs that once needed a person. Let's hope that our future does not turn
      out to be a Terminator meets I-Robot movie. I do agree that technological
      advances are meant to improve life however we should remember that it
      should not replace the human touch. We need to use technology in a way
      that benefits live rather than replace them. By benefitting our lives, I
      imply that it should allow the hearing and visually impaired to experience
      a similar user experience to any other user.
