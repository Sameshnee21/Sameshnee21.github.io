    <h5 class="sub">Changes made in order to incorporate Javascript:</h5>
    <p>
      I have not made any physical changes as yet; however, I have theorized
      possible changes that may better my website. The stressful part of this
      assignment is adding in things to a working website, the constant question
      of “what if it breaks?” is daunting.

      How does this help you streamline your interaction design?:
    </h5>
    <p>
      The changes that I wish to make the user experience better as the
      interaction and features will be improved and more enjoyable to click on.

    <h5 class="sub">Reflection on the readings:</h5>
    <p>
      I feel that this reading was a vortex of what ifs and but maybes. I feel
      that decolonizing technology in this year and age is a difficult issue to
      change because it has taken many years and wars to get the information
      that we have now. With that information, it has built the foundation of
      what we are today. I’m not suggesting that colonialism was a good thing
      but rather it was the only information people had to work with. Now, that
      there is some freedom of speech, we can add to technological advances by
      “cultivating conversation” (Mignolo and Walsh: 2018). It is impossible to
      rewrite the past or change everyone’s perspective, but we can use
      technology to educate the new generation and create awareness of the
      truth. We have the skills, facilities, and the power to bring out the
      truth from culturally reliable sources.
