    <h5 class="sub">Reflection of the Website:</h5>
    <p>
      Although I submitted my assignment late due to my code “acting up”, I felt
      that it was something to be proud of as I initially saw coding as
      intimidating. The biggest struggle was the media queries of some of my
      pages as well as the layout warping during my last-minute tweaking. This
      was disheartening since I could not find the fault in time. I have not
      touched my website, let alone find ways to incorporate Javascript into it.
      My biggest fear is, how can I incorporate Javascript into my website if I
      was unable to fix issues when I used CSS and Html?

      How do this weeks readings impact South African Web Devs:
    </h5>
    <p>
      As a South African, I can say that Africa has come a long way in
      technological advances however, not long enough to go head-to-head with
      international developers. I feel that South Africa has the potential to
      stand out, however guidance and resources do not permit such ventures.
      Another issue that South Africa faces is that “cheaper is better” and
      “safe designs” overtake the will to be unique. This limits the skill sets
      of companies and developers. Western influence plays a big part in
      limiting our potential as it affects participation and representation. The
      world follows Western influence however the western side makes their own
      rules and breaks them once in a while, creatively of course. According to
      Graham et al (2015), African is stuck in the “technical apartheid” as we
      have not moved. The digital world waits for no-one and the sooner South
      Africa realizes that, the better it would be for local developers. In
      order for us to catch this digital train to the future, we need to apply
      and “equalize the opportunity of knowledge and culture” (Graham et al:
      2017) the South African way.
