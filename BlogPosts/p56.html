    <p>
      This has been an interesting process. During the first week of building my
      website, I designed a skeleton of would have been based on my wireframes.
      As I began coding and understanding the requirements for the brief, I
      realized that my design was complicated. This took a new turn in my
      development, which forced me to go back to square one, planning and
      wireframes, this time, simpler. My new approach was to keep the design
      minimalistic and build on it if needs be. Overall, I have had my ups and
      downs with this assignment, but the end result proved that it was worth
      it.
