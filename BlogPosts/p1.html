    <h5 class="sub">My experience with setting up Github:</h5>
    <p>
      Although GitHub is a newly introduced program, after a few beginner
      tutorials, I understood the programs concept better. I learnt that GitHub
      is used to revert and/ or update a website as well as to share data. The
      overall setting up of the program was simple. I look forward to working
      with and learning more about this program through this course.

    <h5 class="sub">Reflection of readings:</h5>
    <p>
      I noticed that the readings were futuristic in terms of mass production,
      technological improvements as well as how information can either help or
      destroy the future generation. “As we may think” by Vannevar Bush (1945)
      was most enjoyable to read as his views of the world and examples
      mentioned created a better understanding about where the world was and
      will be heading towards. “The Library of Babel” by Borges (1944)
      approached the same idea as Bush but in a more fictional angle. I
      preferred the realist approach by Bush as the text was easier to
      comprehend whilst in Borges' reading felt like an overload of information.
      This made me feel claustrophobic as if there was not enough time to go
      through all the books in the library that the writer described. Overall,
      the readings created awareness of the past and future possibilities of
      accessing information and how it has evolved in order to better lives. One
      of the factors mentioned in both readings that I find rather humorous, is
      that the futuristic vision that both writers had, became the reality that
      they believed in. This is evident in today's technological advances such
      as the internet and smart devices used to hold information. It was as if
      they predicted how information would one day be stored and accessed. It
      was a rather fascinating point of view to read which makes me wonder how
      information will be stored in the future years to come.

    <h5 class="sub">Goals for this course:</h5>
    <p>
      My goal for this course is to get through it with understanding and
      confidence. I wish to be able to design apps that create an unforgettable
      user experience that may assist as an educational tool.

      "This made me feel claustrophobic as if there was not enough time to go
      through all the books in the library that the writer described." I love
      this! I agree completely. It's a heady and terrifying feeling that there
      is just so much, and that you can never get to it all. "One of the factors
      mentioned in both readings that I find rather humorous, is that the
      futuristic vision that both writers had, became the reality that they
      believed in." Take a look at Star Trek. There are moments of technology in
      there that are just plain awsome - like tablets and the holodeck - but the
      way they were imagined in the 80's/90's. The thing about sci-fi, (and even
      some magical realism), is that it is an extrapolation. It looks at the
      world as it is: technology, social structures, political structures and
      events, and says: what if... It is also always a commentary on the
      present, but using the distance of fiction as a foil. "that may assist as
      an educational tool" Oohhh, I am very very interested in education and
      educational tools, so if you ever want to talk or read more about it, I'll
      send you so much stuff!
