    <h5>My experience with setting up Github:</h5>
    Although GitHub is a newly introduced program, after a few beginner
    tutorials, I understood the programs concept better. I learnt that GitHub is
    used to revert and/ or update a website as well as to share data. The
    overall setting up of the program was simple. I look forward to working with
    and learning more about this program through this course.

    <h5>Reflection of readings:</h5>
    I noticed that the readings were futuristic in terms of mass production,
    technological improvements as well as how information can either help or
    destroy the future generation. “As we may think” by Vannevar Bush (1945) was
    most enjoyable to read as his views of the world and examples mentioned
    created a better understanding about where the world was and will be heading
    towards. “The Library of Babel” by Borges (1944) approached the same idea as
    Bush but in a more fictional angle. I preferred the realist approach by Bush
    as the text was easier to comprehend whilst in Borges' reading felt like an
    overload of information. This made me feel claustrophobic as if there was
    not enough time to go through all the books in the library that the writer
    described. Overall, the readings created awareness of the past and future
    possibilities of accessing information and how it has evolved in order to
    better lives. One of the factors mentioned in both readings that I find
    rather humorous, is that the futuristic vision that both writers had, became
    the reality that they believed in. This is evident in today's technological
    advances such as the internet and smart devices used to hold information. It
    was as if they predicted how information would one day be stored and
    accessed. It was a rather fascinating point of view to read which makes me
    wonder how information will be stored in the future years to come.

    <h5>Goals for this course:</h5>
    My goal for this course is to get through it with understanding and
    confidence. I wish to be able to design apps that create an unforgettable
    user experience that may assist as an educational tool.

      "This made me feel claustrophobic as if there was not enough time to go
      through all the books in the library that the writer described." I love
      this! I agree completely. It's a heady and terrifying feeling that there
      is just so much, and that you can never get to it all. "One of the factors
      mentioned in both readings that I find rather humorous, is that the
      futuristic vision that both writers had, became the reality that they
      believed in." Take a look at Star Trek. There are moments of technology in
      there that are just plain awsome - like tablets and the holodeck - but the
      way they were imagined in the 80's/90's. The thing about sci-fi, (and even
      some magical realism), is that it is an extrapolation. It looks at the
      world as it is: technology, social structures, political structures and
      events, and says: what if... It is also always a commentary on the
      present, but using the distance of fiction as a foil. "that may assist as
      an educational tool" Oohhh, I am very very interested in education and
      educational tools, so if you ever want to talk or read more about it, I'll
      send you so much stuff!
