    <h5 class="sub">Development of my website (Part 2):</h5>
    <p>
      As my website begins to take some shape, I realised that this assignment
      is harder than it looks. This means one thing and one thing alone...I
      should have started it earlier (oops). I have watched a few tutorials on
      Youtube to make the process speed up abit but some tutorials are way too
      advanced. I have learnt that simple is the way to go and if you have time
      to break and put back together, then do it. Overall, I am in a state of
      love/ hate with my assignment...Mostly love after I added the css files
      (the spice).

    <h5 class="sub">Process Mashup Lecture Slides:</h5>
    <p>
      The lecture slides became an aid to developing my website, especially for
      the design section of my website. The goal alignment for my website is
      that I would like my users to explore and have fun interacting with my
      design without any complications. My website is simple and functional
      which means that the user will not get lost or frustrated. The most
      interesting parts in my website are the title pages for each section. The
      content mapping on the other hand was easy on paper but a challenge in
      code. I managed to further simplify the design in order to make the design
      breathable. The interface elements are easy to spot and use. The user can
      navigate their next move easily with scratching for additional buttons.
      Overall, the slides benefitted me immensely .

    <h5 class="sub">Reflection on the readings:</h5>
    <p>
      User experience ties in with human computer interaction, and as technology
      progresses so does the emphasis for interaction and usefulness in design.
      Carrol and Thomas in Hassenzal and Tractinsky (2011) state that design is
      not seen as fun, but once people realise many open with a fun mindset or
      approach to design, the possibilities become endless. I agree with this
      approach, if fun can influence user experience, then wouldn't that mean
      that the design was successful? A key aspect to make a design successful
      is to have behavioural goals that create a sort of intimacy between user
      and computer. It is a challenging task to accomplish however through the
      use of a focus group, designers can pin point elements and emotions to
      create a better user experience.
