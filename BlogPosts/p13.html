    <h5 class="sub">Development of my website (Part ...):</h5>
    <p>
      I found this assignment to be challenging as there was much additions that
      I would have liked to incorporate however due to "simple is better" and
      time constraints, I took an easier route. Using Javascript was a challenge
      as it took much time to understand and apply. I attempted to create a
      better user experience however ther is a chance that I have worsened it
      (oops).

    <h5 class="sub">Reflection on the readings:</h5>
    <p>
      Kasapis (2020) states that during the pandemic, the digital inequalities
      surfaced as the world was forced to go digital. Not many people had access
      to a digital device or the internet for that matter. This brought about a
      disadvantage to a large number of people. Daniolou (2020), elaborates that
      without internet access, there was a barrier for “equal opportunity and
      cultural growth”. Rural areas struggled the most as they were shut out of
      the digital world. Such places have a massive disadvantage due to the lack
      of education, “lower income and restricted healthcare and travel services”
      (Daniolou:2020). Once the government took action, there was a positive
      outcome that led people to develop and encourage connectivity. Internet
      connectivity should be seen as a basic need as it plays a big role in our
      lives, from learning, teaching and even for connecting with different
      people. There are downsides to the internet such as illegal activities but
      that cannot stop the world from growing. In order to decrease such
      activities, there should be “proper education” (Daniolou:2020) put in
      place.
