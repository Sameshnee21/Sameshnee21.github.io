    <h5 class="sub">Development of my website (the untouched):</h5>
    <p>
      These three languages are linked by complimenting each other in
      functionality. They work hand in hand to make a website whole. My CSS
      relates to the styling of my website and the atmosphere I would like to
      set for each page. The Javascript times the designs displayed to set a
      tone, if my designs are displayed too fast, it would cause the user to
      lose interest.

    <h5 class="sub">Responsive design biting my behind:</h5>
    <p>
      Responsive websites are “cool” to look at and interact with, however the
      work put into something like this is difficult and time consuming. The end
      result also doesn’t go according to plan on some pages (for example refer
      to the portfolio page and the design section page). Both pages have the
      exact code, however it is clear which one works better for some odd
      reason.

    <h5 class="sub">Reflection on why code matters:</h5>
    <p>
      When thinking about how our code matters in digital colonialisms, can you
      identify any things in your own coding practice that you should be aware
      of: Based on the reading, “How we code matters” (2022), is a way of
      expressing oneself through language, that being coding. It is a technical
      language that needs to be carefully thought through and applied for others
      to understand. As people we are conditioned to think and act in a certain
      way due to colonialism. We tend to follow the western ways as they look
      and feel “right”. The digital knowledge that we have now was underlined by
      “techno-colonialism” (Geyser: 2022) which in turn altered digital
      knowledge. This means that there is much more out there than we’ve known
      and been exposed to. The digital world is growing rapidly and the software
      sector is guilty of “exclusion, marginalization, unethical technologies
      and research practices” (Geyser: 2022). We can solve this problem by being
      more involved in the technological war created by the past. This is not an
      easy fix, but it will take years in order to reach the heights or even
      surpass the western world. Coding is becoming a universal language of the
      world. It is the type of language that can put South African on the map.
